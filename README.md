# Generic-LinkedList

## Project Architecture 

```sh
├── Cell.java
├── LinkedList.java
├── README.md
└── TestLinkedList.java
```

# Goal

My goal for this project is to have a simple piece of code that I can use for multiple projects. 
The LinkedList is plain and simple, here are the methods develloped : 
1. addHead()
2. addTail()
3. removeHead()
4. removeTail()
5. toString()
6. size()
7. insertHere()
8. removeCell()
9. swap()
10. reverse()
11. get()
12. merge()


# Futures features

Add a sort function that will take a comparator function to sort the list, that will be implemented using quick sort algorithm.
